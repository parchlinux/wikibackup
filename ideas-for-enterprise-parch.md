# Ideas for Parch Enterprise

In this contribution, I, [Muhammadreza Haghiri](https://haghiri75.com/en) write my whole ideas about the project and its enterprise edition. As I mentioned to a private friendly chatroom, this will be my last contribution to Iranian FLOSS community. 

I am not here to force Parch's team to do what I say, I'm here only to help and pay my 2 cents to this project which I think has potentials. 

## Ideas

- __Name__ : Although the combination of _Persian_ and _Arch_ became Parch, but we should see the truth. The name and its Persian meaning (jug, pitcher, etc) became a matter of trolling and making fun of the project. In my personal and honest opinion, a new name can be a good start.
- __Freeze current project__: Current project, although it has thousands of users and downloads, is better to become dormant and only receive necessary updates. Do not make yourselves busy updating with a window manager no one - except the creator - is using! In short, do not waste time. 
- __Forget about Enterprise Workstations__ : No one will leave those crappy Windows machines behind, focus on server. 

## Ideas Specifically for Server 

Just take a page from _Univention_'s book. This is a great project. 

## More to think

- Router
